# DCS2015
A University Distributed Computing Systems module; has tut examples and worked example/own code for socket programming.

##Contents
###TFTP Folder
Create a TFTP Client and a server.

You are required to:
1. Implement both a TFTP client and a TFTP server.
2. Write in C using the Berkley Sockets API. You run on a Linux system.
3. Transfer in octet (8-bit raw binary mode).
4. Transfer a file no larger than 10MB.
5. Demonstrate both “get” and “put” functionality.
6. Handle errors gracefully.
A standard TFTP client and TFTP server will be available for testing.

_The first release branch is for an Internet Engineering prac which requires only a TFTP client with GET functionality_
_All new commits are for Project 1 in DCS._

###SimpleClientServer Folder

This was for understanding sockets, some basic scripts. It also has a simple client/server pair for Tut 1:

3.Implement your OWN chargen server (you will not be able to run this on a port below 1024) using C and the Berkley Sockets API on Linux.
4. Test the implementation of your chargen server using telnet
5. Implement you OWN chargen client using C and the Berkley Sockets API on Linux.
6. Test this client with a standard chargen server
7. Test your client with your server.

_The second release branch is for the client/server pair submission. See details in the source code for features._
